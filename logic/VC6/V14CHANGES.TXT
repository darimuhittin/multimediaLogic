This file thoroughly lists the changes made from version 1.3 to 1.4.

- 64KB mode for Memory device (16-bit address)
- Reset/Clear lines option for Flipflop devices
- Fix emulation of Flipflop LO-LO (hold) state
- Save spaces in filename strings in devices properly
  (previously truncated at first whitespace)
- Prevent zoom in / zoom out too far (crash)
- Problems with NULL FILE* pointers in devices (crash)
- Memory device was leaking FILE* handles
- Problems with Halt() during Initialize()
- Other Reset() problems related to failure cases
- Make AnodeNULL variable document-specific instead of a global
  variable. Avoids problems when a simulator is active
  (including paused) and the unconnected node type
  is changed for another document.
- Nicer icon for document (instead of white rectangle)
- Edit/Find should not make a selection if sim running,
  but should go to the correct page
- Add missing Invalidate() call to BreakGate Simulate()
  when image is supposed to change
- BreakGate now displays gate's page upon break, if necessary,
  so user can see which BreakGate was hit
- Calls to btn.Autoload() in dialog.cpp were generating
  a debug warning. This is because the correct call
  should be btn.SubclassDlgItem(). Fixed.
- In some places (especially Reset()), objects from the m_objects list
  are blindly cast to CLogiGate*, but wires do not descend from CLogiGate*.
  Fixed to use the CLogiObj* base class where appropriate.
- The Cut operation is now identified with the string "Cut" to
  the undo system. (Previously showed up as "Delete".)
- Disable View, Grid Settings when running/paused
- Replace "MS Sans Serif" with "MS Shell Dlg", which is
  the proper font to use in recent MFC. (in logicli.rc)
- Rebuilt RTF and HLP files which were missing
  (I have not revised the text, however)
- Added some Tips of the Day regarding new features
- Now compiles with no warnings

- Nodes queued for update if their state changes, instead of processing
  every node every cycle. Hugh performance increase if there are many
  nodes in the project.
- Similar change to PostSimulate handling.
- Reimplemented undo/redo. Transactions supported. Move and property edits now undoable.
- Copy/paste was pasting bad wires in some cases, when selection did not include both endpoint devices.
- Configurable canvas size in Simulate, Setup dialog
- Configurable simulation rate in Hz via Simulate, Setup dialog
- Goto Page dialog with support for giving each page a name.
- Add canvassize, simrate, and pagename tokens to file format to implement
  saving of these new document properties. The changes are backward compatible.
  That is, the previous release will open the files created by this release but
  ignore the new features.
- Windows XP theme support when running on Windows XP
  In particular, addition of manifest.xml resource
- Snap to Grid while moving mode now supported.
- A Signal Sender device may now have multiple Signal Receivers.
- Workaround for DP/LP rounding errors that caused bad repaints in zoom mode.
- Similar DP/LP fixes to drawing of the selection rectangle.
- Fixed bug in wire numbering on 3-input mux/demux device images.
- Fixed state change bug in bus device that manifested following the addition of the node queue
- Fixed propagation of bus float though Signal sender/receiver
- Disallow Undo, Redo, Paste, Select All, Snap Selection to Grid when simulator running
- Simulator will display a message if attempting to run a project with Port IO
  devices on a WinNT system.
- Fixed popup menu to enable/disable items as appropriate
- Implemented OnSetCursor for tools, so cursor is properly updated while moving
  across views in the splitter frame
- Find/Replace text in selected items, or entire project if nothing selected
- Fixed detected memory leaks. Most were in document destructor and the undo system.
- Changed wire tool to display a "no" icon when trying to draw an illegal wire
- Minor fixes to menu items, especially duplicate mnemonics and status bar text
- If document window closed while Paused, the Palette is redisplayed if desired
- Cleaned up the VERSIONINFORMATION resource, as WinXP Explorer displays this info
  in the "tiled" file view
- Changes to Tip of Day needed for paint to be compatible with Windows XP support
- Used an automated utility to renumber resources, to correct duplicate resource numbers
- Put Zoom In / Zoom Out buttons on toolbar
- When zoomed out far, fill entire rectange with gray instead of drawing oversampled grid dots,
  which was very slow
- Bumped version number to 1.4
