MED  Reset on Robots (goes to initial position, could reset playground).
MED  Reset on Playgroud.
MED  Grid should be in registry.
MED  Grid needs to be split from trim.
MED  When not in wire mode treat nodes same as device select (node device).
     or Make selecting node easier (Not possible to select wire, then).
 
LOW  Switch Wave over to PlayWave, why?
LOW  Allow no wait on sound devices (Wave Done, Beeper?).
LOW  Switch, Remove Momentary always on
LOW  Wires, Push to rear (tried didn't look good)
LOW  Wires, Allow invisable
LOW  Sound, Make like bitmap

V1.2 Right mouse actions.

Done HIGH Initial position should be based on the hotspot not the upperleft.
Done HIGH Rotate hotspot based on heading.
Done HIGH Reduce Signal sender/reciever bitmap size.
Done HIGH Shut off resize handles.
Done HIGH Robot bitmap pencil, eye glasses.
Done HIGH Fix edit.. in dialogs with bad file name.
Done HIGH A select that includes a wire without both devices and autoscrolls
          causes error during autoscroll which causes a crash (on save?)
Done HIGH Need to double check some devices (FF/MUX) to see if they call base class simulate too often.
          (seems ok).
Done HIGH Dialog for each device even if no props.
Done HIGH Autoscroll, Fix left over garbage
Done HIGH Wires, Autoscroll broken
Done HIGH Finish ALU.

Done MED  General, Cleanup Unknown on some devices like display and memory.
Done MED  Display, Cursor.
Done MED  Display, Delete key.
Done MED  Printing, Fix font on display and signal devices
