MultiMedia Logic is a combined logic design schematic entry
system and logic simulator.  It includes the standard
complement of devices such as AND, OR, NAND, NOR, Adders and
Counters etc.  But MMLogic goes one step beyond these devices
by including MultiMedia devices such as a "Wave" device,
a "Bitmap" device, a "Robot" device, a "Buzzer" device and
more.  This allows you to interact with your logic simulation.
Your "circuits" can span the classroom or the Internet by
using the "Network" device.  The simulator is a 6 state
(True, False, Unknown, PullDown, PullUp and Float) event
driven simulator.  Schematics can be printed in full color.
You can think of MultiMedia Logic as "Visual Programming"
where the language is "Logic" and the data type is a bit.
Ages 8 and up, you can start very simple (switches and LEDs)
to very complex (build games that run over the Internet).
